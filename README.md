# Model: Responsible Business Simulator

Welcome to the open-source GitHub repository of the Responsible Business Simulator (RBS) model based on the {LINK_TO_BOOK}. 
This repo allows users to understand the framework and interact with the model, providing the opportunity to experiment, 
evaluate, and collaborate. The RBS model is designed to simulate the impact of business decisions on sustainability 
and social responsibility. By open-sourcing the code, we promote transparency and invite contributions from 
researchers and practitioners.
